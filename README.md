# Prisma Cloud Inspection Script

## Description

The `pcs-inspect.py` script queries the Prisma Cloud API for all enabled Policies
and for all Alerts within a Relative Time Range (with a default of one month) for a Tenant,
and outputs results to an Excel spreadsheet, including worksheets for:

* Alerts By Compliance Standard
* Alerts By Policy
* Alert Summary
* Utilization Summary

### Requirements

* (Developed and tested on) Python 3.x with the `pandas`, `requests`, and `xlsxwriter` libraries.
* Prisma Cloud Access Key with `ACCOUNT GROUP READ ONLY` or `SYSTEM ADMIN` privileges.

### Usage

* Download this repository
* If necessary, install the required libraries
* Identify the `--customer_name` parameter via Support -> Customers in the same stack as the Tenant
* Create or select an Access Key with a Role higher than "Build and Deploy Security" in the Tenant
* Execute the `pcs-inspect.py` script to collect and process * the data
* Import the results into Google Sheets, and/or Google Slides (for example: [PCS Inspect Report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10x_PGAu0ZPUGZMc4Tfevf9gpXvhIUOwGrBuRBkI6Jjc/edit?usp=sharing))
* Profit!

(* You can independently execute the collect and process steps of the script by specifying `--mode collect` or `--mode process`)

As an alternative to using a Tenant Access Key,
you can inspect a subset of data by specifying an Access Key generated by a "LIGHT AGENT" Support User in the same stack as the Tenant
(for example: inspect the `SESandBox` tenant in the `https://app.prismacloud.io/` stack)
by specifying a Support User Access Key and `--support_api`.

Use `./pcs-inspect.py -h` for a complete list of parameters.

### Example

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

chmod +x pcs-inspect.py

./pcs-inspect.py \
  --customer_name "Example - 1234" \
  --url "https://api.prismacloud.io" \
  --access_key "aaaaaaaa-1111-aaaa-1111-aaaaaaaa1111" \
  --secret_key "ssss1111ssss1111ssss1111="
```

### Troubleshooting

In general, specify `-d` to enable debugging.

If you receive an error when the script generates an API token:

* Verify that the Access Key is valid for the specified Stack and Tenant
* Validate the URL, Access Key, and Secret Key parameters

If you receive an error when the script queries an API endpoint:

* Validate that the Customer Name is complete and correct as per Support -> Customers
* Validate that the Access Key has the necessary Role to access the API
* Do not use a Tenant Access Key when specifying `--support_api`
* Do not use a Support User Access Key unless specifying `--support_api`
* Validate that the Support User has "LIGHT AGENT" permissions when specifying `--support_api`

Note that details for some server-side query errors not are returned by the API!
