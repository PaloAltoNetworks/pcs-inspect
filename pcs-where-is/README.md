# Prisma Cloud Tenant Locator Script

## Description

The `pcs-where-is.py` script queries the Prisma Cloud Support API for a tenant by Customer Name.

### Requirements

* An Access Key generated by a "LIGHT AGENT" Support User in each stack.

### Usage

Edit the script to include your keys (replacing None in each os.environ.get()) or set as env vars:

```bash
export CA_BUNDLE=
export API_ACCESS_KEY=
export API_SECRET_KEY=
export API2_ACCESS_KEY=
export API2_SECRET_KEY=
export API3_ACCESS_KEY=
export API3_SECRET_KEY=
```

(You could also edit the script to add configuration for other stacks.)

### Example

```bash
tkishel  ~ | Code | pcs-inspect | pcs-where-is  ./pcs-where-is.py example
